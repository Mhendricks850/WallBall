# WallBall
Wall Ball is a simple casual game that is easy enough for your grandma to play, but hard enough to never beat your own record. This is the first gameplay footage of a new app called Wall Ball. The goal is to avoid the squares to earn points, with the technique of using the wall to earn extra points. Challenge your friends and family to play and see who can get the highest score!
